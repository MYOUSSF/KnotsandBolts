is a picture of a mathematical [knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics)). The following is a knot too

Althgouhg the two pictures might look similar, the two knots are `different`, i.e we can not continuousely deform one to obtain the other, see definition  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_isotopy). In fact, it's a fundamental question in knot theory to tell whether two knots are the same or not.

To distinguish between knots mathematicians have developped a number of features that they assign to these knots. However these features contain a lot of redundancies and, most of the time, are very hard to compute. We use deep learning to give us insight into these features and try to determine any relationships between them.
